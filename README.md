# Dialog Directive

a angular dialog component

# Requirements

- AngularJS

# Preparation

# Testing

We use karma to ensure the quality of the code.  The easiest way to run test is to use grunt:

    npm install
    npm test

The karma task will try to open a browser in which to run the tests. Make sure this is available or change the configuration in test\karma.config.js
